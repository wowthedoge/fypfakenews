# fypfakenews

FYP for fake news detection. Let's get HD guys.


**Setting up**
1. Place your dataset (currently only .csv) in /datasets
2. Change `csv_file_path = 'datasets/fakenewsnet.csv'` to your .csv file name.
3. Run main.ipynb
4. Probably download the packages. I haven't yet made a requirements.txt, sorry.


**Push**
Github has a file size limit so please don't push trained models or datasets here. Include them in /datasets or /models and they will automatically not be pushed. Otherwise manually update the .gitignore.
